# layout/

Layout components define spatial structure, not content.

They answer:
- Where does the observer stand?
- How does one move between worlds?
- Where does the page begin and end?

They do NOT:
- Contain knowledge
- Fetch data
- Explain concepts

## Rules

1. Layout components must be static and predictable.
2. No domain content (Earth / Sky / Human) lives here.
3. Names describe space, not function.
4. Layout defines order; sections define meaning.

> Layout is the architecture of attention.
